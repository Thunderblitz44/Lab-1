LAB 01: Getting to Know the Unity Timeline

Adam Fifield, understand that I am bound by Ontario Tech’s Academic Integrity Policy
(https://usgc.ontariotechu.ca/policy/policy-library/policies/academic/academic-integrity-policy.php) which
sets out the kinds of actions that constitute academic misconduct, including plagiarism, copying or
allowing one’s own work to copied, use of unauthorized aids in examinations and tests, submitting work
prepared in collaboration with another student when such collaboration has not been authorized, among
other academic offences.

Adam Fifield understand that a lack of familiarity with these regulations on academic conduct does not constitute a defense against its application.

Adam Fifield attest that I have completed the LAB 01: Getting to Know the Unity Timeline requirements on my own and the work submitted is my own original work.

NOTES ON MARKING

Forgive me for my loud computer fan playing in the videos, I will get a better microphone when I have more money.
